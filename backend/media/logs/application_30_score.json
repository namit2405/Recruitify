    "fit_summary": "The candidate's evaluation data indicates a very low skill match of 0.0% and no relevant work experience, which are significant concerns for the Web Developer role. The candidate is also missing all the required technical skills, including css, django, git, html, javascript, python, react, responsive design, rest api, and sql. Furthermore, the candidate lacks relevant keywords such as api integration, backend development, and frontend development, which are essential for the position. The candidate's education match is the only positive aspect, but it is not enough to compensate for the lack of skills and experience. Overall, the candidate's profile does not align with the job requirements, and their final score of 17.73% reflects this. The semantic similarity of 4.88% also suggests that the candidate's background and the job description do not have much in common. Given these findings, it is unlikely that the candidate would be a strong fit for the Web Developer role.",
