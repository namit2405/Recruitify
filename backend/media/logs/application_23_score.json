The candidate also meets the minimum experience requirement of 2 years. However, the semantic similarity score is relatively low at 15.13%, indicating that the candidate's background and experience may not be a perfect fit for the company's specific needs. The candidate is also missing some important keywords such as cross browser compatibility, performance optimization, and web security, which are crucial for a web developer role. Despite these gaps, the candidate's overall score of 83.27% suggests that they have a solid foundation in web development. With some additional training or experience, the candidate could be a strong fit for the role. Overall, the candidate's technical skills and experience make them a viable candidate for the position.",
