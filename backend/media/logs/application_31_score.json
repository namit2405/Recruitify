The candidate is also missing all the required skills, including css, django, git, html, javascript, python, react, responsive design, rest api, and sql. Furthermore, the candidate lacks relevant keywords such as api integration, backend development, and frontend development, which are crucial for the position. The education match is the only positive aspect, but it is not enough to compensate for the lack of skills and experience. Overall, the candidate's profile does not align well with the job requirements. The final score of 17.73% and semantic similarity of 4.88% also suggest a poor fit. The candidate's job title does not match the role, which further reduces their suitability.",
